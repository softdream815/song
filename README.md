### Selenium

In order for this project to work in your computer; You need to have a selenium and python installed in your computer. 
I assume if you are interested in this project,you already know the basics of python and you have python installed. 

For window users: Open windows terminal and open project directory. 

    pip install selenium

#### **Drivers**
Selenium requires a driver to interface with the chosen browser. Firefox, for example, requires geckodriver, which needs to be installed before the below examples can be run. Make sure itâ€™s in your PATH, e. g., place it in /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin.

Read more about webdrivers here [Selenium Installation](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/) and [Selenium Official documentation](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/)


#### **Downloading WebDriver**
This project uses chromedriver. I understand that you're using a different browser;

Here are download links for most popular browsers. 

[Chrome](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)

[Firefox](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)

[Edge](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/)

[Safari](https://webkit.org/blog/6900/webdriver-support-in-safari-10/)

Once you download your prefered driver; You can either save the .exe file in your project folder or you can save it somewhere in the your computer and provide the path. I recommend you save it in a different folder within the project folder or somewhere in your computer and use system path methods to access it. 

## Quick Guide
### client_input folder

 The first thing you would want to do is to set your variables. These will set the foundation on what the bot should do in terms which city to enter in booking.com     search box, generating date ranges etc. Open *client_input/destination_param.csv*  file and fill the data for  the following required variables.
 
      place - Where you want to go, prefered to enter a city name. 
      start_month - lays the foundation on where to start the checkin dates and updates the checkout. 
      start_year - the start year.  
      duration - How long is your stay. The duration helps the bot to generate date ranges starting from next_month and set checkin and checkout dates. 
      adults - Number of adult,
      rooms - number 0f rooms
      
### run the bot
